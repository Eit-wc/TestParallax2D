# TestParallax2D

This program is designed for artists to test their background images by animating them as parallax layers.

## Controls

* Select a folder containing PNG background images. The order of images and parallax layers will be arranged alphabetically, so it's recommended to name your images with numbers for easier management (e.g., 01_ground.png, 02_tree.png, ...)
* Right-click and drag the mouse to simulate character movement

## Features

- Easy background image testing for parallax effects
- Automatic layer ordering based on filename
- Simple mouse controls for movement simulation
- Support for PNG image formats

## Usage

1. Prepare your background images as PNG files
2. Name them with numerical prefixes for proper ordering (01_, 02_, 03_, etc.)
3. Launch the program and select your image folder
4. Use right-click + mouse movement to test the parallax effect

## Requirements

- PNG format background images
- Images should be named in alphabetical/numerical order for proper layering
